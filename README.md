## About

As a developer who has spent considerable time with Xcode's default dark theme, switching to a different color scheme has always been a challenge. This theme was born out of the desire to maintain the familiar and comfortable syntax highlighting from Xcode while incorporating the beautiful UI elements from the Charmmono Theme.


## Why This Theme?

After trying numerous VS Code themes, I found myself constantly returning to Xcode's default dark theme due to its familiarity and clarity. However, I wanted to enhance the overall VS Code experience with better UI elements. This theme combines the best of both worlds:

- Xcode's syntax highlighting that I've grown accustomed to
- Charmmono's sleek UI elements that make VS Code look and feel more polished

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X)
3. Search for "IDX Xcode - Xcode syntax and IDX Theme"
4. Click Install
5. Select the theme through Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) > "Preferences: Color Theme" > "IDX Xcode - Xcode syntax and IDX Theme"


## Credits

This theme is a combination of two amazing themes:

- [Xcode Default Theme](https://github.com/Nataniel4/xcode-vscode-theme) - For the syntax highlighting colors that closely match Xcode's default dark theme
- [Charmmono Theme](https://github.com/sumangal44/charmmono-theme) - For the excellent UI elements and overall theme structure
